# ChirpBird

Welcome to Haraj take home challenge!

In this challenge you will be assigned to help fictional startup called `ChirpBird` to create their instant messaging platform. Basically they want to create platform similar like [Facebook Messenger](https://www.messenger.com/), [WhatsApp](https://www.whatsapp.com/), or [Telegram](https://telegram.org/).

`ChirpBird` have vision to make it easy for people around the world to stay connected. It is your job to make that happen through your system. üòÅ

## Requirements

You need to create system with client-server architecture. For the server you need to develop it using [Go](https://golang.org/). As for the client, you just need to create a web app (you could use whatever tools you want to create the web app).

The system needs to be:

1. Capable of delivering message instantly through Websocket
2. Capable of delivering text message
3. Capable of hosting P2P & Group chat
4. Horizontally scalable
5. Resilient from failure (since the system will be distributed, there should be tons of potential failures)

## Deployment

It is not mandatory to deploy your system on public. However if you decided to do so, it would be very great. 

At the very least you need to deploy your system using docker-compose.

## Evaluation

1. System design
2. API documentation
3. System fail safe strategy
4. Code readibility, cleanliness, & testability
5. UI comfortability (good UX)
6. Deployment strategy (bonus)
